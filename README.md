# Data visualization of a dataset from NASA

Here I do a data exploration of the data using *pandas*, *seaborn*, *numpy* and *matplotlib* answering the questions

* What is the most common year with spacial explorations?
* What is the status of the astronauts?
* What is the month with the most births of astronauts? 
* What is their military rank?
* What is the average of Space Flight, in *hr*
